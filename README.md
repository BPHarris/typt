# Introduction
This is the GitHub repository for my third-year project at the University of Warwick. The project aims to create and implement a statically typed programming language, named **`typt`**, which will compile to Python 3.

In this repository is the file `typt.py` which is the compiler for `typt` programs. Additionally, the file `Typt/Type.g4` contains the grammar definitions of the language. The `test` folder contains several exemplar `typt` programs for unit testing; the `test.py` file performs the unit tests.
